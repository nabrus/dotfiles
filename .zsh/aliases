alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfgFiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
# Replaces the regular `git` command to use `dotfiles` instead to
# interact with the config files repository from any location. 
# It also configures the `--bare` repo, setting `$HOME` as the work tree
# and stores Git state at `.cfgFIles`.
