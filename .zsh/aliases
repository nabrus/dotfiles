alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/.cfgFiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'
# Replaces the regular 'git' command to use 'dotfiles' 
instead to interact with our configuration repository 
from any location. It also configures the '--bare' repo 
to set '$HOME' as the work tree and store the Git state 
at '.cfgFIles.
